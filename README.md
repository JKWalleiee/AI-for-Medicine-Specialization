# AI-for-Medicine-Specialization
This repository contains Notebooks with my solutions for the assignments of the "AI for Medicine Specialization" on Coursera.

There are 3 Courses for **"AI for Medicine Specialization"** which are:
## 1. AI for Medical Diagnosis
   - The nuances of working with 2D and 3D medical data
   - Convolutional Neural Network for diagnosis of lung disease by looking at a chest X-ray.
   - Segmentation model for detecting brain disorders.

[Week 1](https://github.com/JKWalleiee/AI-for-Medicine-Specialization/tree/master/AI%20for%20Medical%20Diagnosis/Week_1): Training of a Deep learning model that can interpret chest X-rays to classify different disease causes.<br>
[Week 2](https://github.com/JKWalleiee/AI-for-Medicine-Specialization/tree/master/AI%20for%20Medical%20Diagnosis/Week_2): Evaluation methodologies to assess the quality of a model.<br>
[Week 3](https://github.com/JKWalleiee/AI-for-Medicine-Specialization/tree/master/AI%20for%20Medical%20Diagnosis/Week_3): Image segmentation to identify the location and boundaries of brain tumors in MRI scans.<br>

## 2. AI for Medical Prognosis
   - Learn how to work with Structured data
   - Risk models and survival estimators for heart disease using tree-based statistical models to improve patient survival estimates. 
   - Random forest predictor to determine patient prognosis.
 
[Week 1](https://github.com/JKWalleiee/AI-for-Medicine-Specialization/tree/master/AI for Medical Prognosis/Week_1): Build and Evaluate a Linear Risk model.<br>
[Week 2](https://github.com/JKWalleiee/AI-for-Medicine-Specialization/tree/master/AI for Medical Prognosis/Week_2): Risk Models Using Tree-based Models.<br>
[Week 3](https://github.com/JKWalleiee/AI-for-Medicine-Specialization/tree/master/AI for Medical Prognosis/Week_3): Survival Estimates that Varies with Time.<br>
[Week 4](https://github.com/JKWalleiee/AI-for-Medicine-Specialization/tree/master/AI for Medical Prognosis/Week_4): Cox Proportional Hazards and Random Survival Forests.<br>

## 3. AI For Medical Treatment
   - Build a treatment effect predictor, apply model interpretation techniques
   - Natural language processing to extract information from radiology reports
   - Explore how Natural language extraction can more efficiently label medical datasets.
